<p>Working with time most likely is a new dimension to consider. Before making things move, we want to make sure we have a plan for that movement. Pick a simple task and thoroughly document that task through photographs. Perform the same task multiple times taking photos from different angles and at different times. Now, translate that documentation into a storyboard and design concept boards for key frames. The storyboard will give you an idea of pacing and narrative while the concept boards will show the visual language of the finished sequence. The fictional, final sequence would have a title slide with the name of the sequence, have around 5â€“15 seconds of action, and have ending credits.</p>
